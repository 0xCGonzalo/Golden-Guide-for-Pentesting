# FUZZING

#### You should be smarter when using fuzzing from the outside. Here are some good points for this process.

## Domains and Subdomains

When you reach out a list of domains and subdomains , fuzzing against these:

### Basic GET
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X GET
```

### Basic POST, PUT
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X POST
```
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X PUT
```

### Follow Redirections
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X GET -r
```

### Extensions

Without redirection:
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X GET -e ".php,.asp,.xml,.txt,.sh,.js,.aspx,.py"
```
With redirection:
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X GET -r -e ".php,.asp,.xml,.txt,.sh,.js,.aspx,.py"
```

### Capture All HTTP Status and Filter Out the Unnecessary
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://victim/FUZZ -X GET -r -e ".php,.asp,.xml,.txt,.sh,.js,.aspx,.py" -mc all --fc=404
```

### Subdirectory of Subdomain

At this point, you should be consider that one subdomain maybe can be part of the first subdirectory in the URL, for example:
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://subdomain.victim/subdomain/FUZZ -X GET -r -e ".php,.asp,.xml,.txt,.sh,.js,.aspx,.py"
```
```
ffuf -w g0ld3n-ok.txt -u http://subdomain.victim/subdomain/FUZZ -X POST -r -e ".php,.asp,.xml,.txt,.sh,.js,.aspx,.py"
```

### Look in Source Code

In each subdomain, you need to look more closely for potential paths in the source code.

Search the source code for `user`, `username`, `password`, `password`, `.html`, `.php`, `.sh`, `.asp`, `.aspx`, etc. 

This will give you an advantage that the classic word list does not have.
