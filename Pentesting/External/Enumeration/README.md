# Assets discoveries

> You were said that everything belonging to some company is inside the scope, and you want to figure out what this company actually owns.

The goal of this phase is to obtain all the **companies owned by the main company** and then all the **assets** of these companies. To do so, we are going to:

1. Find the acquisitions of the main company, this will give us the companies inside the scope.
2. Find the ASN (if any) of each company, this will give us the IP ranges owned by each company
3. Use reverse whois lookups to search for other entries (organisation names, domains...) related to the first one (this can be done recursively)
4. Use other techniques like shodan `org`and `ssl`filters to search for other assets (the `ssl` trick can be done recursively).

## Acquisitions

First of all, we need to know which **other companies are owned by the main company**.

One option is to visit [https://www.crunchbase.com/](https://www.crunchbase.com), **search** for the **main company**, and **click** on "**acquisitions**". There you will see other companies acquired by the main one.

Other option is to visit the **Wikipedia** page of the main company and search for **acquisitions**.

> Ok, at this point you should know all the companies inside the scope. Lets figure out how to find their assets.

## ASNs

> An autonomous system number (**ASN**) is a **unique number** assigned to an **autonomous system** (AS) by the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**.

> An **AS** consists of **blocks** of **IP addresses** which have a distinctly defined policy for accessing external networks and are administered by a single organisation but may be made up of several operators.

It's interesting to find if the **company have assigned any ASN** to find its **IP ranges.** 

It will be interested to perform a **vulnerability test** against all the **hosts** inside the **scope** and **look for domains** inside these IPs.

You can search by **company name**, by **IP** or by **domain** in **[**https://bgp.he.net/**](https://bgp.he.net)**.

Depending on the region of the company this links could be useful to **gather more data:**

- [**AFRINIC**](https://www.afrinic.net) (Africa)
- [**Arin**](https://www.arin.net/about/welcome/region/) (North America)
- [**APNIC**](https://www.apnic.net) (Asia)
- [**LACNIC**](https://www.lacnic.net) (Latin America),
- [**RIPE NCC**](https://www.ripe.net) (Europe). 

You can find the IP ranges of an organisation also using [http://asnlookup.com/](http://asnlookup.com) (it has free API).

You can find the IP and ASN of a domain using [http://ipv4info.com/](http://ipv4info.com).

## Scan for Vulnerabilities

At this point we known **all the assets inside the scope**, so if you are allowed you could launch some **vulnerability scanner** (Nessus, OpenVAS) over all the hosts.

Also, you could launch some port scans, go to [**Network Scan Section**](https://github.com/0xCGonzalo/Golden-Guide-for-Pentesting/tree/master/Pentesting/External/Network%20Scan) **and use services like** shodan **to find** open ports.



# Domains

# Subdomains

## Why so many tools and techniques?
The more techniques used, the more chances to find interesting subdomains that others might have missed.

Some bug hunters recommend using only a handful of tools (like Amass, Massdns, Subfinder & Gobuster). But people who have a bad Internet connection & no VPS won’t be able to use these highly effective & fast tools. So choose whatever works for you!

## Methods

- Scraping
- Brute-force
- Alterations & permutations of already known subdomains
- Online DNS tools
- SSL certificates
- Certificate Transparency
- Search engines
- Public datasets
- DNS aggregators
- Git repositories
- Text parsing (HTML, JavaScript, documents…)
- VHost discovery
- ASN discovery
- Reverse DNS
- Zone transfer (AXFR)
- DNSSEC zone walking
- DNS cache snooping
- Content-Security-Policy HTTP headers
- Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records
- Subject Alternate Name (SAN)

## Techniques

### DNS Recon
```
dnsrecon -a -d target.com
dnsrecon -d target.com
```

### Dorks
Google, Bing
```
site:target.com -www
site:target.com -site:www.target.com
site:*.target.com -site:www.target.com -site:help.target.com
```

### Sublist3r
```
sublist3r -d target.com
```

### Knockpy
```
python3 knockpy.py target.com
```

### Altdns
You need a previously wordlist of subdomains for take 

Generate a list of altered subdomains:
```
./altdns.py -i known-subdomains.txt -o new_subdomains.txt
```
Generate a list of altered subdomains & resolve them:
```
./altdns.py -i known-subdomains.txt -o new_subdomains.txt -w words.txt -r -s results_output.txt
```

Other options
- -w wordlist.txt: Use custom wordlist (default altdns/words.txt)
- -t 10: Number of threads
- -d $IP: Use custom resolver

### Amass
```
amass enum -d target.com
amass enum -d target.com -r 8.8.8.8
```

### Censys
```
python censys_subdomain_finder.py target.com
```

### Subfinder
```
subfinder -d target.com
```

### The Harvester
You must configure all the API KEYS before running it for best performance.
```
theHarvester -d target.com -b all
```
